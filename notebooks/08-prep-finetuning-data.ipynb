ModFreakz has the hottest new decals for your Sony PS4 Slim console. Our skins are made with quality that no other gaming skin company can match. Our generation is getting more and more technical, and the need to stand out from the crowd is crucial. We are here to help with the newest trends for your digital style.  Easy installation guide:  1. Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly.  2. Clean the surface of your device with isopropyl alcohol. This ensures that there is no dust and oil, and will allow the adhesive to properly bond. 2. Warm the skin with a hair dryer before you begin to make it more malleable, being careful not to overheat and warp the skin.3. Once the skin is applied, use a squeegee or flat item like a credit card to gently and smoothly press the skin onto the surface (warming it again will help eliminate any wrinkles or bubbles). Start in the middle of the shortest edge and run all the way down the center to the opposite edge. Continue pushing the skin onto the console in straight lines running parallel to the longest side of console. Work from the center out to avoid bubbles.\n",
